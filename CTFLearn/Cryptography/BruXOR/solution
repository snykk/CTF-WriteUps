Steps:
1. The tittle is "BruXOR" i think its mean Bruteforce XOR.
2. so, i decide to decode this cipher with online decoder.
3. there are many online decoder for XOR bruteforcing. in this challenge we use cyberchef.
4. when we decrypt that cipher, we found many weird strings. we have to scroll down and read one by one and see the strings like english senteces.
5. after a couple of second we found the flag
	flag -> flag{y0u_Have_bruteforce_XOR}
