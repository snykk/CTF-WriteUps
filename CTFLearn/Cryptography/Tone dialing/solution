Steps:
1. we given the wav file that contain beep beep sound. yeap just beep beep.
2. lets try to search on the google what is that mean with the key "tone dialing".
3. after first time goolge it, we suggest that the file is the DMFT cryptography.
4. next step we need to online decoder for decrypt the wav file into the plain text. and i found this -> http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/index.html
5. the result of steps 4 is the only number. i think its for a decimal number. so i listen again the wave for group into the decimal number. and the result for that is the "number" file that i have been make.
6. i make simple python program to convert from decimal number to char. and voilaa we get the flag.
	flag -> CTFlean{CRYPTOGRAPHY}
