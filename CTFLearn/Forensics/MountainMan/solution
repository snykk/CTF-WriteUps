Steps:
1. if we look at the desc "Don't be fooled by two 0xffd9 markers.". there is mention about "0xffd9", and i sure that it is a hex who contains in image file.
2. lets try to search this stuff in internet.... yeap it is for EOI (end of image)
3. so lets try to open hex editor (in this case i use wxhexeditor).
4. evidently, we got 2 EOI inside MountainMan.jpg
5. after a view minute i realize if we provided another hint in the desc "XOR is your friend"
6. i think the 2 EOI is the barrier of the bruteforce xor cipher. so lets copy it and past into the bruteforce xor decode (in this case im gonna use cyber chef)
7. when we try to xorbruteforce, we get the flag. yoo hoo
