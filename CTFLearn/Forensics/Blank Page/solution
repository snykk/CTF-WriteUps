Steps:
1. if we first opened "TheMessage.txt" we will get nothing. everything is blank
2. dont worry we cant try to opened this file with xxd which that is the hex editor or we can also open this file in cyberchef.
3. copy that dots and space stuff in the weird file.
4. i think its a morse but whe i try to convert the morse into text i get nothing.
5. after a couple of minutes i think that dots ans space is the binary that dots represent 1 and space is represent 0. each binary is separate by space so we can assume that every mod of 8 is space
6. i already make the simple python script that solve this problem.
7. when i run the script we will get the flag... voilaaa
	flag -> CTFlearn{If_y0u_r3/\d_thi5_you_pa553d}
