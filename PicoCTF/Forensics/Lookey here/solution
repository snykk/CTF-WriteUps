Steps:
1. first, when we try to read this file with cat command we just get a bounch of word that lazy to read
2. i think we need to filter that word with important key like the template flag.
3. so try to grep this result (cat result) with grep command
4. type, cat anthem.flag.txt | grep pico
flag -> picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_58f5c024}
