Steps:
1. extract object file (tftp) from wireshark
2. in here we get 3 picture, 2 txt (instruction and plan), and last deb program
3. when we first time for looing at the txt file we think its been encrypt with caesar cipher. so we have to decrypt first using bruteforce approach. i already make a program to solve this. then, yeap, we get the plain text.
4. try every possible that flag hidden in this file with strings command, exiftools, zsteg, stegsnowm steghid, etc for each picture
5. after a long whil we got a txt file inside the picture3.
6. nice one.
