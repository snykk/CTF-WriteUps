1. Any hints about entering a command into the Terminal (such as the next one), will start with a '$'... everything after the dollar sign will be typed (or copy and pasted) into your Terminal.
2. To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/2d24d50b4ebed90c704575627f1f57b2/flag`
3. `$ man cat`

### Solution
The challenge gives us a link to download a certain data. We can use `wget` command to download data directly from terminal. After that, we get a file named "flags". try using `cat` command to show raw content of file, also we can use `string` command to get all readable content. And then, Voila we get the flag. easy start is it?

## Python Wrangling

### Description

Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run [this Python script](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0bf545252b5120845e3b568b9ad0277e/ende.py) using [this password](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0bf545252b5120845e3b568b9ad0277e/pw.txt) to get [the flag](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/0bf545252b5120845e3b568b9ad0277e/flag.txt.en)?

### Solution

Download all sources first using `wget` command. We must get the python script, encryption text and password. And then, See what python script actually does.Now we are ready to decrypt the message using the command `python ende.py -d <encrypt_file_path.txt.en>`. Last, don`t forget to insert password correctly.

## Wave a flag

### Description

Can you invoke help flags for a tool or binary? [This program](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b28b6021d6040b086c2226ebeb913bc2/warm) has extraordinarily helpful information...

### Information

***Point Value***: 10 points

***Category***:  General Skills

### Hints

1. This program will only work in the webshell or another Linux computer.
2. To get the file accessible in your shell, enter the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b28b6021d6040b086c2226ebeb913bc2/warm`
3. Run this program by entering the following in the Terminal prompt: `$ ./warm`, but you'll first have to make it executable with `$ chmod +x warm`
4. -h and --help are the most common arguments to give to programs to get more information from them!
5. Not every program implements help features like -h and --help.

### Solution

we have an ELF file. Try to run this, but change the access permission first with chmod +x to make file executable
> chmod +x warm
> ./warm

output:
> Hello user! Pass me a -h to learn what I can do!

Try to add more arguments with pass an "-h" to the program
> ./warm -h
