steps:
1. try to login with random username like asdf, and it's false
2. try to login with admin, evidently we just bypass the username authentication. but we have to crack the password too
3. if we look at the network in dev tools, we can't she the traffic. so we suggest there is no server side in this website (POST form)
4. then, we try to look at the view page source, and click the .js file. we get some stuff in here
5. we found encrypt string like "YWRtaW4" as the username and "cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ" as the password
6. we already know that is the chyper text from base64 so we have do decrypt first to get the password in plain text with echo "chypertext" |base64 -d
7. finally we get the password, and it turns out the password is a flag
	password/flag -> picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}
