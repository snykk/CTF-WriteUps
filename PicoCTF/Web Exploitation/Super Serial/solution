Steps:
1. first, open the link to get the page (link -> http://mercury.picoctf.net:14804/)
2. try to look at the view page source.
3. nothing usefull in here, lets try to open robots.txt in this current path
4. we get /admin.phps. yeap, that is for admin, we can't go there. so lets try to open index.phps maybe we get some information.
5. right!! we can read the back end proccess. let's look at the authentication.php
6. looks like the page after validation, maybe we have to see more information in view page source.
7. the cookie.php emerge twice, in this page and previous page. lets try to catch this.
8. in here we have "deserialization  error" in error handling php.
9. try to insert "login" name in cookie with random value, yeap we get our "deserialization error". this is the vuln off this web.
10 try to make objek encode with base64 as we saw before in index.phps and class in cookie.phps. we can type some command below and run it on php file or online php editor
	<?php
	// Your code here!
	class access_log
	{
		public $log_file = "../flag";
	}
	echo urlencode(base64_encode(serialize(new access_log())));
	?>
11. copy the string output and paste it on the value of "login" cookie that we have before
12. reload the page
13. voilaa we get the flag
	flag -> picoCTF{th15_vu1n_1s_5up3r_53r1ous_y4ll_261d1dcc}
